# Coursera Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains my projects and assignments for the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai.

## Courses

This specialization consists of three courses:

1.  [Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](./course-1-supervised-ml/README.md)
2.  [Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms](./course-2-advanced-learning-algorithms/README.md)
3.  [Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement Learning](./course-3-unsupervised-learning-recommenders-rl/README.md)

Each course directory contains my work for that course, organized by week.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

├── course-1-supervised-ml
│   ├── week-1
│   │   ├── week-1-notes.md
│   │   └── ... (assignments, labs)

## Enhanced Learning Experience

This repository goes beyond standard note-taking by incorporating interactive and visual elements to deepen understanding:

*   **📊 Visualizations:** Complex concepts like Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and K-Means clustering are visualized directly in the markdown using **Mermaid diagrams**.
*   **💻 Code Snippets:** Practical **Python/NumPy** implementations of key functions (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU) are provided alongside the theory.
*   **navigation:** All notes include a **Table of Contents** for quick navigation to specific topics.

## Note-Taking System (SQN)

This project uses a "Structured Queryable Notes" (SQN) system to facilitate active learning and retention.

### Philosophy: From Scribe to Architect

The goal is not just to transcribe lecture content, but to actively question, structure, and connect the material to build a robust knowledge base.

### How to Use

For each week, a pre-filled note file (e.g., `week-1-notes.md`) is provided. The system uses the following legend to categorize information:

*   🔑 **Key Definition:** For critical, must-know vocabulary.
*   ❓ **Question:** For things you don't understand or want to explore later.
*   🔗 **Connection:** For links to your existing knowledge.
*   💡 **Insight:** For "aha!" moments or key takeaways.
*   ⚠️ **Warning:** For common mistakes, pitfalls, or important limitations.

At the end of each module, fill out the **Module Summary** section from memory *before* reviewing your notes to solidify your learning.

A blank template, `note_template.md`, is available in the root directory for any additional notes or future courses.
