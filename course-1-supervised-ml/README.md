# Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

This directory contains my projects, assignments, and notes for the first course in the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization.

## Course Overview
This course covers the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, focusing on building and training prediction models. It introduces the core concepts of regression (predicting numbers) and classification (predicting categories).
