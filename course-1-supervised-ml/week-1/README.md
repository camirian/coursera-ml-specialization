# Week 1: Introduction to Supervised Learning

## Module Summary
This week introduced the fundamental concepts of supervised machine learning. I learned about the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and the two main types of supervised learning problems: regression and classification. The core of the week was understanding linear regression with one variable, how to measure its performance with a cost function, and how to optimize it using gradient descent.

## Key Concepts
*   **Introduction to Supervised Learning:** Understanding the difference between supervised (labeled data) and unsupervised (unlabeled data) learning.
*   **Regression and Classification:** Distinguishing between predicting continuous values (regression) and discrete categories (classification).
*   **Linear Regression with One Variable:** Modeling the relationship between a single feature and a target variable using a linear hypothesis `h(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x`.
*   **Gradient Descent:** An iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function and find the best parameters for the model.
