# Week 1: Introduction to Neural Networks

## Module Summary
This week introduced the fundamental building blocks of neural networks. I learned about the basic architecture, including input, hidden, and output layers, and the role of individual neurons. A key concept was the activation function, which introduces non-linearity, with a focus on the Sigmoid and ReLU functions. The process of making predictions with a neural network, known as forward propagation, was also covered, which involves passing data through the network layer by layer.

## Key Concepts
*   **Introduction to Neural Networks:** Understanding the structure of neural networks (neurons, layers) and their ability to learn complex patterns.
*   **Model Representation:** Input, hidden, and output layers.
*   **Activation Functions:** Sigmoid and ReLU functions and their role in introducing non-linearity.
*   **Forward Propagation:** The process of calculating the output of the network.
