# Week 1: Unsupervised Learning and Clustering

## Module Summary
This week introduced the paradigm of unsupervised learning, where the goal is to find hidden patterns in unlabeled data. The primary focus was on clustering, a common unsupervised learning task. I learned about the K-Means algorithm, an iterative method for partitioning data into a predefined number of clusters (K). The importance of the cost function (distortion) in evaluating the quality of the clustering and the sensitivity of K-Means to initial centroid placement were also key takeaways.

## Key Concepts
