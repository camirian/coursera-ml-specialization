# Week 2: Recommender Systems

## Module Summary
This week shifted focus to recommender systems, a powerful application of machine learning. I learned about the two main approaches: content-based filtering, which uses item features to make recommendations, and collaborative filtering, which leverages the preferences of similar users. A key and powerful collaborative filtering technique, matrix factorization, was introduced. This method can learn latent features of users and items, leading to highly personalized and effective recommendations.

## Key Concepts
*   **Introduction to Recommender Systems:** Predicting user preferences.
*   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommending based on item attributes.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommending based on similar users.
*   **Matrix Factorization:** Decomposing the user-item matrix to find latent features.
