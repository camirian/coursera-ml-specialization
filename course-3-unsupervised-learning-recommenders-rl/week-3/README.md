# Week 3: Reinforcement Learning

## Module Summary
This week introduced the exciting field of reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent learns to make optimal decisions through trial and error. I learned the core components of an RL problem: the agent, environment, state, action, and reward. The mathematical framework for RL, the Markov Decision Process (MDP), was introduced. A key focus was on value functions and policies, which represent the agent's knowledge and behavior. Finally, I was introduced to Q-learning, a powerful algorithm for learning an optimal policy without needing a model of the environment.
